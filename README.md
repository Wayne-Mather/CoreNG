## CoreNG Readme

Welcome to CoreNG. This is my little project on how I build Enterprise Based Applications that use a mix of .NET Core and Angular.

It is opionated, probably not best practice, probably not the best code, but it has worked for me to build really large and complex applications.

## Budget App
This is the budget app. It demonstrates how to create an application that has a mix of Identity, Entity Framework (SQL Server & SQLite), Razor Pages & hosted Angular 6+ SPA apps.
